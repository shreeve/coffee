I have a copy of CoffeeScript 2.7.0 at @v27/ and an upgraded version at @v28/ which swaps out Jison for Solar (a JSON-directive based parser for AST node creation and code emission). I also have an ES6 version of CoffeeScript at @v29/ where we are using a hand tuned parser in v29/lib/coffeescript/parser.js (which we don't need to modify) and upgraded CoffeeScript source files in v29/src/*.coffee. In order to rebuild the v29/lib/coffeescript/*.js files we can do this as follows:

cd /Users/shreeve/Data/Code/coffee/v28
npm run build  # this will rebuild the v28/src/*.coffee files to v28/lib/coffeescript/*.js
npm run build6 # this will rebuild the v29/src/*.coffee files to v29/lib/coffeescript/*.js

So, v28 is responsible to run as a bootstrap, and reads our ES6-ized *.coffee files from v29/src/*.coffee and emits ES6 ready JS files to v29/lib/coffeescript/*.js.

The goal is to get all of the v29 *.coffee files converted by v28's nodes6.coffee to ES6 JS files in v29/lib/coffeescript and then to be able to run v29 at ES6! Note that type: "module" is set in v29's package.js file. Also, not that v28/src/nodes6.coffee is very similar to v29/src/nodes.coffee (except v29 has other ES6 CoffeeScript fixes).

Can you scan through all these files and, without making any changes or write to disk, tell me what your understanding is of this project?
