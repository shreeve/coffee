# CoffeeScript Solar Directive Compiler - Agent Handoff

## Current Status: 326/326 tests passing (100%)

### Latest Achievements
- Fixed Try/Catch with `then` syntax by emitting proper `Catch` nodes (inspired by es6 backend)
- Class static property with colon syntax `@static: 10` now emits `F.static = 10`
  - Minimal fix in `cs290/src/es5.coffee`: mark object-context `@prop:` assigns as `this` (`variable.this = true`)
  - No nodes.coffee surgery required
- Test runner and grammar stabilizations retained; full suite green

### Grammar Simplifications (kept behavior identical)
- Removed fused THIS tokens from grammar (and didn’t require any lexer support):
  - Deleted `THIS_PROPERTY` / `THIS_CONSTRUCTOR` paths
  - Standardized on:
    - `This`: `THIS` and bare `@`
    - `ThisProperty`: `@ Property`
  - Relied on generic `Accessor/Index` for `@.prop` and `@[expr]`
- Parser rebuilt; no conflicts; performance unchanged

### Key Files
- `cs290/src/es5.coffee` — ES5 backend (Assign tweak for static)
- `cs290/src/syntax.coffee` — Grammar with Solar directives (simplified THIS rules)
- `cs290/test/runner.coffee` — Stable, no hacks required

### Commands
```bash
cd /Users/shreeve/Data/Code/coffee/cs290
npm run parser   # rebuild parser after syntax changes
npm run build    # recompile sources
npm run test     # run full suite
```

### Notes
- The compiler helpers (e.g., `flatten`) are internal to the compiler runtime; generated JS doesn’t depend on them.
- Keeping the Assign tweak in `es5.coffee` is required for `@prop:` static in class bodies; nothing else needed.

### Git
- Branch: main
- Status: changes pushed for 100%; later grammar-only cleanups were tested locally without committing unless requested.
